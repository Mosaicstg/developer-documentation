# External Support Guidelines

## Hosting/Vendor Support

### During Interaction
1. Get the **what** — What specifically failed?
2. Get the **why** — Root cause, not symptoms
3. Log ticket #, timestamps, rep names

### Post-Support
- Document technical findings in project notes
- Create non-technical summary for stakeholders

## Synthesizing for Non-Technical Audiences

| Technical | Non-Technical |
|-----------|---------------|
| 503 / memory exhaustion | Site down due to traffic spike |
| SSL cert expired | Security certificate needed renewal |
| DB connection timeout | Site couldn't reach its database |

### Stakeholder Update Template
> **Issue:** [Plain language]  
> **Impact:** [User experience]  
> **Resolution:** [What was done]  
> **Prevention:** [Next steps]
